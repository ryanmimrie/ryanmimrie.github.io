## Background

Hello, my name is Ryan M. Imrie. I am a virologist with extensive experience of microbiology, statistics, bioinformatics, and programming. My academic career began with a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences at the University of Exeter, where I studied sources of variation in the outcomes of infection across host species using a *Drosophilidae* model experimental system. Following this, my postdoctoral research has taken me to the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, where I am currently building within-host mathematical models of acute virus infection. In addition to my work in academia, I frequently collaborate with industry partners on a wide variety of projects, which has allowed me to experience areas of microbiology research I might never have encountered on my own.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking around the nearby Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, curling up on the corner sofa with a book, or tackling self-inflicted coding challenges. My current "for-fun" challenge is creating a 6-dimensional version of Snake — traditionally a 2-dimensional game — and a computer algorithm that can efficiently and safely find paths through this 6D space.
