# Ryan M. Imrie
## Background

  <div style="font-size: 0.95em; flex: 1;">
    I am a virologist currently working at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research in Pablo Murcia's research group, where I am building within-host mathematical models of acute virus infection.
    <br><br>
    My academic career began with a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences at the University of Exeter, supervised by Ben Longdon, where I studied sources of variation in the outcomes of infection across host species using a <em>Drosophilidae</em> model experimental system.
    <br><br>
    In addition to my work in academia, I frequently collaborate with industry partners on a wide variety of projects, which has allowed me to experience areas of microbiology I might never have encountered on my own.
