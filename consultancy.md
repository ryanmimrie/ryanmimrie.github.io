## Services

I have been actively collaborating with industry partners for several years and am happy to receive any new inquiries. Feel free to contact me at ryan.m.imrie@gmail.com with any questions.

#### Assay Design, Wet-Lab Workflows, and SOPs

I have many years of experience in molecular biology wet-lab techniques, with a particular focus on improving usability, reliability, and throughput for the following techniques:
<ul>
    <li>DNA & RNA extraction from animal tissue, bacterial and animal cell culture, and stool samples.</li>
    <li>Single and multiplex conventional PCR.</li>
    <li>qPCR and qRT-PCR.</li>
    <li>Oxford Nanopore sequencing library preparation and multiplex sequencing.</li>
    <li>DNA & RNA targeted amplicon sequencing.</li>
</ul>

#### Bioinformatics Analysis and Workflows

I have extensive experience of bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing data, including the design of bespoke solutions for unique projects. While I am happy to receive enquiries about any bioinformatics projects, I can offer expertise in the following:
<ul>
    <li>Illumina and Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing, quality control, and library analysis.</li>
    <li>Reference sequence alignment and assembly.</li>
    <li>De novo genome assembly.</li>
    <li>Genome annotation.</li>
    <li>Metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics analysis.</li>
    <li>RNAseq alignment and expression analysis.</li>
    <li>Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction.</li>
</ul>

#### Bespoke Coding Solutions

Some projects require novel or unique solutions to data collection, wrangling, and analysis. With over a decade of experience coding in Python, R, Bash, and Javascript, I am happy to provide bespoke coding solutions to any projects that require them. This includes the development of web apps and GUIs that can be easily interacted with by non-coders. Some examples of past projects are:
<ul>
    <li>A Python image processing pipeline to isolate and quantify endosomes in 3-dimensions from confocal microscopy images.</li>
    <li>A custom Bash script to demultiplex Oxford Nanopore reads prepared with Illumina sequencing barcodes.</li>
    <li>An custom R script to efficiently extract and combine qRT-PCR amplification data from many StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR files.</li>
    <li>An R image processing pipeline to segment and quantify melanisation of <em>Galleria mellonella</em> larvae from raw DSLR images.</li>
</ul>

#### Statistical Analysis and Reporting



## Consultancy Rates

The following are my standard consultancy rates, negotiable for any large or recurring projects:
